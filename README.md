Dataset features biometrics and health related quality of life (HRQOL) outcomes for 268 post-liver-transplant patients experiencing sleep disturbances.

Goal of the project was to iteratively build and assess models for predicting patient scores. 

Biometric and demographic features were implemented in building models to predict scores for the following sleep scales:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Berlin Sleep Scale (BSS).

<br>

Actual observed ESS, AIS, and BSS scores were implemented as features in building models to predict scores for the following health HRQOLs:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mental Component Score (MCS)

<br>

Models were assessed by Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) comparisons and analysis of variance; priority was placed on AIC scores.
